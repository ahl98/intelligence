    Abstract: Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform
    important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and
    cost-effective where manual programming is not. As more data becomes
    available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine
    learning is widely used in computer science and other fields. However,
    developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial
    amount of "black art" that is hard to find in textbooks. This article
    summarizes twelve key lessons that machine learning researchers and
    practitioners have learned. These include pitfalls to avoid, important
    issues to focus on, and answers to common questions.

    Abstract: Deep learning allows for computational models that are composed of
    multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple
    levels of abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-
    of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object 
    detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep
    learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the
    backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its
    internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each
    layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional
    nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech
    and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such
    as text and speech.
