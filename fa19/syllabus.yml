    Welcome to the Intelligence group! This meeting, we'll be discerning
    everyone's research interests, whether passive or active. Following that,
    we'll start narrowing paper topics to fill the 5 unplanned meetings so
    everyone can begin getting a feel for the breadth of computation as a field
    of research.

    Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform important tasks by
    generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and cost-effective where
    manual programming is not. As more data becomes available, more ambitious
    problems can be tackled. As a result, machine learning is widely used in
    computer science and other fields. However, developing successful machine
    learning applications requires a substantial amount of black art that is
    hard to find in textbooks. This article summarizes twelve key lessons that
    machine learning researchers and practitioners have learned. These include
    pitfalls to avoid, important issues to focus on, and answers to common
    questions.

    Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in
    building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have
    come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as
    object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance
    that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their
    biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ
    from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive
    science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines
    will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they
    learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines
    should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and
    understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems;
    (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to
    support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness
    compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize
    knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and
    promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of
    recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.

    We agree with Lake and colleagues on their list of key ingredients for
    building humanlike intelligence, including the idea that model-based
    reasoning is essential. However, we favor an approach that centers on one
    additional ingredient: autonomy. In particular, we aim toward agents that
    can both build and exploit their own internal models, with minimal human
    hand-engineering. We believe an approach centered on autonomous learning
    has the greatest chance of success as we scale toward real-world
    complexity, tackling domains for which ready-made formal models are not
    available. Here we survey several important examples of the progress that
    has been made toward building autonomous agents with humanlike abilities,
    and highlight some outstanding challenges.
