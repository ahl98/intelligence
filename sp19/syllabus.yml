    Abstract: Machine learning algorithms can figure out how to perform 
    important tasks by generalizing from examples. This is often feasible and 
    cost-effective where manual programming is not. As more data becomes 
    available, more ambitious problems can be tackled. As a result, machine 
    learning is widely used in computer science and other fields. However, 
    developing successful machine learning applications requires a substantial
    amount of "black art" that is hard to find in textbooks. This article
    summarizes twelve key lessons that machine learning researchers and
    practitioners have learned. These include pitfalls to avoid, important 
    issues to focus on, and answers to common questions.
